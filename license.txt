                      Macrophysics

Prisma Macrophysics (PM) is a comprehensive software package to perform computational analysis
of physical problems on the macro scale level that couples many fields. It focuses on the ease
of usability, backward compatibility and aim to lower the barrier for entry user. Furthermore,
the scripting interface with both Python 2 and Python 3 are supported. It is compilable and
runnable on Android systems.

PM comprises of two primary components, namely the kernel and the extensions (applications).
The kernel of PM is adopted and modifed from Kratos Multi-Physics. On the extension part, PM
develops its own applications. It is noted that PM does not use any applications developed
in Kratos Multi-Physics package and hence its applications will not be interoperable with
Kratos Multi-Physics applications.

The license of the kernel for PM can be found in kratos/license.txt.
Individual license for each application can be found in the corresponding directory.
